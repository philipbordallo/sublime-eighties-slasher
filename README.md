### About

Base16 Eighties by [Chris Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson) is one of my favorite color schemes for Sublime Text but most of itâ€™s incarnations are too heavy on the red for JavaScript highlight. This fixes that as well as some added features.

##### Other features
- JSON keys are a different color from the JSON value making them easier to distinguish from JSON values
- JavaScript string template expression markers (`${}`) are less emphasized making embedded expressions easier to parse
- Markdown text content is all the same color (except for in-line bold & code) making for better readability
